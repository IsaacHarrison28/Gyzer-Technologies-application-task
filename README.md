## OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT

This is a complete simple movie site that pulls data from an api and returns it to the user. The user is then given the chance to store some of the movies as their favorites and they can always find the movies stored in their favorites route no matter which device they access the site from because their favorite movies are posted and stored in a database collection.

## FRONTEND COMPONENTS

The front end is built entirely using only html, css and javascript. This is so because the task description requires that the site be built with these technologies.

## API AND SERVER

The server is built with Node.js and Express.js which defines all required methods and requests to ensure that the site is powered efficiently.
All the methods and actions required to be carried out by the site are defined comprehensively within the server and the different server end points are used by the front end.
The server also is responsible for communicating with the database as well as the external movie API (TMDB)["https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started"]
